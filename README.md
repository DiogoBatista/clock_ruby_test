# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add to, and subtract minutes from it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

---

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests from the exercise directory using the following command:

    ruby clock_test.rb

Red, green, refactor. On passing a test, see if you can refactor your solution,
or whether you want to proceed to the next test.
